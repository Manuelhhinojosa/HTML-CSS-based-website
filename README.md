### Quik Intro :

This website, designed for a fictional restaurant, was created using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills in web design. It features four main pages and incorporates an external map to display the restaurantâ€™s location. The clean, visually appealing layout highlights my proficiency in crafting well-structured and responsive web pages with HTML and CSS.
